# Space Invader 2018

## What it does
Space Invaders 2018 allows gamers to use their phone as a motion controller for the classic game.  By visiting our website, players can link their phones to their computers.  Through a combination of tilting the phone left and right and tapping the phone screen, the players can shoot at alien invaders while dodging incoming fire.  As a bonus, defeated aliens periodically drop letters that can be collected to spell "PennApps" for extra points.

## How we built it
We used Node.js and Socket.io to bind the user's phone with their computer screen.  By creating a real-time bridge, we successfully created a motion controller that could interact with client-side javascript and html5.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It was exciting to watch our work on the backend create a seamless connection between phone and computer - a feat we were unsure was possible to accomplish. Furthermore, we are proud that we were able to build a well-polished game complete with graphics, audio, and fully functional game mechanics in such a short time.

## What's next for Space Invaders 2018
(Space Invaders 2019??) We hope to integrate our game controller with other games and to eventually create a universal platform for motion-based phone controllers.
